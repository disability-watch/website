**UPDATE**  
On the 11th November 2022, Premier Inn released the following statement on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/premierinn/status/1591111307188916225)

    At Premier Inn we take the needs and equal treatment of our guests extremely seriously 
    and all team members receive disability awareness training to make sure all our guests 
    get the same warm welcome and enjoy a great stay. So we were shocked and appalled to see 
    the upsetting Twitter thread alleging that a guest was asked to leave one of our hotels in
    Enfield.

    An urgent investigation is already underway with the hotel to find out exactly what's happened 
    and we've reached out to the guest to fully understand the circumstances of what has taken place 
    and apologise for the upset caused. We have a zero tolerance approach towards discrimination and 
    work extensively with organisations that support disabled people - this only strengthens our 
    determination to ensure this kind of incident never happens again.

**UPDATE 2**  
On the 12th November 2022 MP Feryal Clark received a [response](https://twitter.com/FeryalClark/status/1591464707709456384) from Premier Inn's Managing Director, Alison Brittain regarding the incident pledging to investigate.
